# BÃ¡lint's DOS Game Library

![Build](https://github.com/balintkissdev/bdgl/workflows/Build/badge.svg)

**NOTICE:**
This library is in **pre-release** state. The API is being experimented on and
is subject to constant changes during this phase that could break the code
compatibility of client applications using the library. Do not rely on the
stability of API until first version is released.

## Introduction

A work-in-progress C library for DOS game programming, currently containing DOS
graphics-related functions and has an API reminiscent of SDL. 16-bit programs
compiled with a Open Watcom and linked with this library work under DOSBox.
The currently supported DOS compiler is Open Watcom 1.9 and
Open Watcom V2 on Windows and Linux.

## Building

The recommended compiler to use is the recent Open Watcom V2 compiler, although
Open Watcom 1.9 is also supported. You can download the binary release
from https://github.com/open-watcom/open-watcom-v2/releases/download/Current-build/ow-snapshot.tar.gz
and extract it somewhere, but better yet, you can use the bundled
`install_deps.py` script under the `scripts` folder to download and extract
inside a `deps` folder in the project.

1. Clone this repository with Git and enter the project folder.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/balintkissdev/bdgl
   cd bdgl
   ```

2. Execute `scripts/install_deps.py` script with Python 3 to download the
   Open Watcom V2 compiler suite and other dependencies.

   ```bash
   python3 scripts/install_deps.py
   ```

3. Set the Watcom build environment according to the operating system and shell you use.

   ```bash
   # Linux/Unix/MSYS/Cygwin
   source scripts/set_watcom.sh
   ```

   ```powershell
   # Windows command line (CMD)
   scripts\set_watcom.bat
   ```

   ```powershell
   # Powershell
   Unblock-File -Path scripts\set_watcom.ps1; scripts\set_watcom.ps1
   ```

4. Build the library using `wmake`. This will build the linkable static
   libraries for 16- and 32-bit architectures under the `lib` folder and the
   examples in `examples/bin` folder.

   ```
   wmake
   ```

You are done and ready to use the library.

## Usage

Until there's avaible documentation here, see the examples in the `examples`
directory for usage of the API. To compile your program with the library
using Watcom, issue the command

```
wcl -ml -I<directory of BDGL header files> yourprogram.c BDGL.lib
```

Then you'll be able to run your executable in DOSBox.

```
dosbox yourprogram.exe
```

**Note about 32-bit DOS builds:** Running 32-bit DOS programs requires the use of
a DOS Extender. One such as DOS/32A can be downloaded from
http://dos32a.narechk.net. However, executing programs compiled with 32-bit
BDGL is currently not supported.
